0. Math review
1. Process modelling, intuitions of feedback, feedforward and PI control, "Eigen values of the system", Laplace transform
2. CSTR SIMULINK implementation(2input, one output) + linearisation + step response, transfer function to state space, response and analysis of two tank system, signal flow graph
3. Stability and tracking of PI controller, Bode plots (by hand and MATLAB implementation), Standard Gain Time Constant form, SIMULINK model combining 2 delay processes
4. tf approximation, FOPTD & SOPTD using empirical methods: Krishnaswamy & Sundaresan and Skogestad's half rule, Simulating a model and using the data to get an empirical model
5. Root Locus, Gain and Phase Margin- evaluating and tuning controllers (using Bode plots), Pade's approximation and controller tuning using Nyquist's plot
6. Closed loop stability, Feedforward + PI control with filter, Internal Model Contol, ITAE (setpoint/disturbance), Feedforward + tuned PI (feedback), setting up MPC
